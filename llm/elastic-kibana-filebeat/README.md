# Minimalist Elasticsearch-Kibana-Filebeat Ansible deployment

Battled Claude Opus 3.5, ChatGPT o1-preview, and Gemini (free). Claude won although it needed help; the initial prompt wasn't enough for a one-shot answer.

> I'm deploying Elasticsearch 8.11.3 in a legacy on-prem environment. I will use Ansible.
>
> Write an Ansible inventory.yml for a single host "homelab" with user "carlo".
>
> The remote user "carlo" does not have sudo privileges.

> The playbook must:
>
> 1. Download and unpack the Elasticsearch 8.11.3 Linux amd64 binary in /home/carlo/elk
> 2. Download and unpack the Kibana 7.17.9 linux amd64 binary in /home/carlo/elk
> 3. Wipe the keystore (in case we are installing over a previous deployment).
> 4. Set the bootstrap password using "elasticsearch-keystore" for user "elastic" to the environment variable ELASTIC_PASSWORD.
> 5. Using the keystore, create a new user with the value of the environment variable CARLO_ELASTIC_USER and password CARLO_ELASTIC_PASSWORD. The user must have roles "superuser" and "kibana_system"
> 6. Set systemd "linger" for user "carlo"
> 7. Create systemd user jobs for carlo that start elasticsearch and kibana automatically; they should restart after 10 seconds if killed unexpectedly; "carlo" does not have sudo so everything must be in user space.
> 8. Also create an uninstall.yml playbook that stops elasticsearch and kibana, removes the systemd jobs, and wipes /home/carlo/elk

I forgot to ask for Filebeat as well.

Key features of the resulting playbook:

* Installs binary tarballs - no containers or k8s.
* Configures Elasticsearch with a custom user that has privileges to create Kibana index patterns ``.kibana``.
* Configures certificates for "transport": uses ``elasticsearch-certutil`` for CA, http, transport certificates.
* Works for a single node deployment; multiple nodes should be fine too.
* Configures Kibana to use the custom Elastic user over TLS.
* Configures Filebeat similarly; also adds a 14 day index lifecycle policy.
* Configures the custom user using ``elasticsearch-users``; does not require Elasticsearch to be up to use the API endpoint.
* Configures systemd user services for all three components - imagine an on-prem deployment without sudo privileges.

Elasticsearch isn't happy with the default value of ``vm.max_map_count`` so you need to change this and reboot:

```shell
$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Tested on Debian Bookworm üôÇüêß

Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml install_elk.yml
```

Wipe everything:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml uninstall_elk.yml
```

Check if Elasticsearch is up:

```shell
